# M3 Ultra QEMU Host-CPU Phase 3 Results

## Scope

This report records the first complete M3 Ultra CPU-contract matrix for QEMU
11.1.1 with `-M virt`, `-accel hvf`, and `-cpu host`. It compares the
Hypervisor.framework vCPU-configuration view with Linux's guest-visible EL0
CPU-feature ABI. It does not claim to observe the guest kernel's raw EL1
register state.

All guest runs used QEMU `-snapshot`, a read-only vvfat source drive, and no
host privilege. The base root filesystem, macOS boot policy, firmware, NVRAM,
partitions, and internal storage were not modified.

## Evidence matrix

The matrix covered 1, 8, 16, 24, and 32 vCPUs. Every run passed these gates:

- the configured CPU count equaled the online and collected CPU count;
- the collector pinned to and observed every requested vCPU exactly once;
- the online CPU mask remained stable throughout collection;
- every vCPU exposed the same register contract except for the separately
  observed `MPIDR_EL1` value;
- the sysfs identification contract was homogeneous;
- HWCAP/HWCAP2, CPU-0 registers, and sysfs identification were identical
  across all five configured CPU counts; and
- the canonical manifests contained no machine ID, boot ID, or serial number.

The guest exposed 19 of the 20 EL0-probed registers on every vCPU.
`CLIDR_EL1` raised `SIGILL`. The sysfs identity was homogeneous:

| File | Value |
|---|---|
| `aidr_el1` | `0x000000016a695797` |
| `midr_el1` | `0x00000000610f0000` |
| `revidr_el1` | `0x0000000000000000` |

Linux returned the documented safe `MPIDR_EL1` value `0x80000000` on every
pinned vCPU. That value is an EL0 ABI result, not the vCPU's actual EL1 MPIDR.

## Classified host/guest comparison

Five complete register values matched the HVF configuration view exactly at
Linux EL0:

- `ID_AA64DFR1_EL1`;
- `CTR_EL0`;
- `DCZID_EL0`;
- `ID_AA64SMFR0_EL1`; and
- `ID_AA64ZFR0_EL1`.

The report classifies these as `exact-el0-observation`, not as proof of raw
EL1 passthrough. In particular, Linux implements `ID_AA64DFR1_EL1` as
read-as-zero for this userspace ABI, so its exact zero match is inconclusive
without the planned EL1-side observation.

The raw comparison found eight different registers and one EL0-unavailable
register. The comparison report records the eight differences as
`linux-el0-sanitized`, records `CLIDR_EL1` as `observation-unavailable`, and
leaves no register `pending`. Field-level decoding gives these dispositions:

| Register | Changed or unavailable fields | Classification | Reason |
|---|---|---|---|
| `ID_AA64PFR0_EL1` | `CSV3`, `CSV2`, `RAS` | Linux EL0 sanitized | Linux hides these fields from its EL0 CPU-feature ABI. Visible `SVE`, `DIT`, AdvSIMD, and FP fields did not differ. |
| `ID_AA64PFR1_EL1` | `CSV2_FRAC` | Linux EL0 sanitized | Visible PFR1 fields did not differ. |
| `ID_AA64DFR0_EL1` | `CTX_CMPS`, `WRPS`, `BRPS` | Linux EL0 sanitized | Linux exposes no DFR0 fields through this ABI. |
| `ID_AA64ISAR0_EL1` | `TLB` | Linux EL0 sanitized | Visible ISAR0 fields did not differ. |
| `ID_AA64ISAR1_EL1` | `SPECRES` | Linux EL0 sanitized | Visible ISAR1 fields did not differ. |
| `ID_AA64MMFR0_EL1` | `EXS`, `TGRAN4_2`, `TGRAN64_2`, `TGRAN16_2`, `TGRAN4`, `TGRAN16`, `PARANGE` | Linux EL0 sanitized | Linux hides these fields. QEMU also deliberately clamps `PARANGE` to the virtual IPA size, so an EL1 observation is required to distinguish the two transformations. |
| `ID_AA64MMFR1_EL1` | `XNX`, `SpecSEI`, `PAN`, `LO`, `HPDS` | Linux EL0 sanitized | Visible `AFP` did not differ. |
| `ID_AA64MMFR2_EL1` | `E0PD`, `TTL`, `IDS`, `NV`, `IESB`, `UAO`, `CNP` | Linux EL0 sanitized | Visible `AT` did not differ. |
| `CLIDR_EL1` | whole register | observation unavailable | Its encoding is outside Linux's EL0 CPU-feature emulation range; `SIGILL` does not establish a QEMU or HVF gap. |

Here, `sanitized` or `observation unavailable` means the current method cannot
determine the guest's raw EL1 field or value. It does not mean the feature is
absent.

## MPIDR and CLIDR ABI limits

Linux's `HWCAP_CPUID` ABI emulates a defined subset of EL0 `MRS` operations and
returns sanitized, system-wide feature values. It deliberately returns
`SYS_MPIDR_SAFE_VAL`, bit 31 only, for `MPIDR_EL1`. `CLIDR_EL1` uses `Op1=1`
and is outside the accepted feature-register encoding range, so EL0 receives
`SIGILL` even when the guest kernel can read a valid virtual CLIDR.

Consequently:

- homogeneous `MPIDR_EL1=0x80000000` does not indicate broken QEMU topology;
- EL0 `CLIDR_EL1` failure does not indicate missing QEMU cache state; and
- neither value can select a QEMU patch without an EL1-side observation.

## Conclusion and next patch gate

The Phase 3 matrix demonstrates a stable, homogeneous Linux-visible CPU
contract from 1 through 32 vCPUs. It shows no evidence of a QEMU feature-loss
gap in fields Linux exposes through the EL0 CPU-feature ABI.

Do not patch QEMU from the raw register differences. The next evidence step is
a snapshot-only EL1/kernel-side collector for `CLIDR_EL1`, the actual
`MPIDR_EL1`, and the ID fields Linux sanitizes. QEMU instrumentation is an
acceptable alternative if it records the finalized virtual register values
without changing them. Only a difference surviving that comparison becomes a
QEMU patch candidate.
